## In this repository we look at lyrics data that was posted on kaggle.com. Here is a [link](https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics/kernels) to the data.
## In particular we try many different data science techniques on the data such as unsupervised clustering and word2vec models. 

## If the Jupyter notebooks do not render on github simply go [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org) and copy the url of the notebook you would like to view!
